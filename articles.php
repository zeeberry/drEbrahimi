					<h3><a href="index.html">Variation in Solving Programming Problems in an Online SUNY Learning Network Course</a></h3>
			
					<p class="post-info">By <a href="index.html">Dr. Ebrahimi</a> | <span class="date">April 20, 2006</span> </p>
				
					<p>An observation on teaching introductory programming courses on SLN for a period of two terms led me to believe that 
					on-line students try various ways to solve a problem. In the beginning, I got the impression that some of their solution
					approaches were wrong; but after a little investigation, I found that some of the problems solving approaches were correct
					but difficult to understand and not straight forward. However, some of the solutions were interesting, challenging, and 
					unique. Three problem sets will be discussed which were given from the textbook in modules 2 and 3 of the term. The 
					problems were to compute salary with overtime, compute total average mileage per gallon, and parking charge fee. As 
					an instructor who has taught introductory programming for more than two decades, I found several variations in solving 
					a problem, even in a small simple program like a compute salary program. One speculation would be that students use trial
					and error and their own logic to get the correct output, despite not using a common approach. It seems that students 
					in the face to face classes focus on the information from the instructor and disseminate it among each other.</p>

					<h3><a href="index.html">Design of a Web-based Visual Learning System (WVLS) via Plan Across Disciplines</a></h3>
			
					<p class="post-info">By <a href="index.html">Dr. Ebrahimi</a> | <span class="date">April 20, 2009</span></p>
				
					<p>WEB BASED LEARNING systems are becoming common ground for teaching and learning [Arnow, 99; Truong, 05]. A sound 
					design model has the potential to significantly increase the effectiveness of these systems. Teaching and learning 
					can be enhanced when a problem and its solution are visually decom- posed into plans and its sub-plans and subsequently 
					integrated. A plan is an abstraction that visually provides a solution to a problem or to a sub-problem in the sense, 
					it represents a problem from its macro level down to its micro level. Any important concept can be described as a plan
					and it is up to the educator and level of learner to decide on a particular plan. A plan can be visually represented by 
					a dot, a geometric shape or an image. The process of visualizing plan decomposition and then plan integration for a problem
					is demonstrated in WVLS – Web Visual Learn- ing System.</p>

					<h3><a href="index.html">Website Error Analysis of Colleges and Universities on Long Island in New York</a></h3>
			
					<p class="post-info">By <a href="index.html">Dr. Ebrahimi</a> | <span class="date">April 20, 2009</span></p>
				
					<p>College and university web pages are an important forum for reaching out to prospective students and the school 
					community; these web pages also provide valuable information to the public [1,5]. This economical and convenient
					means of disseminating information, which is replacing traditional methods of communication by college catalogs,
					mail, and phone, has tremendous implications. As websites increasingly become a primary source of information, 
					extra care should be considered to avoid any crucial errors [4]. However, how accessible, accurate, helpful, 
					and up to date are college websites?</p>
			
					<p>
					This study investigates 21 Long Island universities and colleges and five institutions from other locations, 
					four of which are Ivy League. The web sites of these schools are analyzed based on criteria known as 7X2 C’s
					analysis in 7 separate layers of web application and development. The 7 pairs of C's are: (content, context),
					(correctness, credibility), (currency, continuity), (completeness, coverage), (consistency, conciseness), 
					(community, customization), and (compelling, creativity).</p>

					<h3><a href="index.html">Why Managers Should Become Better Acquainted With Programming Issues, Web Source Code, and Technology</a></h3>
			
					<p class="post-info">By <a href="index.html">Dr. Ebrahimi</a> | <span class="date">April 20, 2009</span></p>
				
					<p>Over time, the bond between a manager and IT is becoming stronger, signaling the need for more interaction and understanding of both 
					technical capabilities and business goals on the part of managers. This paper posits that managers need to know more about information 
					technology and ctively participate in the IT decision-making team. Furthermore, it suggests how managers can have incrementally to acquire
					some elementary knowledge of programming issues, what shows on the web, what is behind the web (source code), and what is placed on the 
					server (database).</p>
			
					<p>
					In a dynamic market where changes are made in nanoseconds. It is rewarding and may soon become almost mandatory that a multi-talented
					manager will have to deal with change, to add or supervise addition of pragmatic programming, and web update the web in order to be competitive. Key to the process is the increasing communication and interaction between managers and programmers.</p>
