<h2>Web VPCL</h2>
<h3>Web Visual Plan Construct Language: a visual system and method for learning and teaching programming and problem solving</h3>
<p>
 The invention is a system and method used for teaching and learning computer programming. This system incorporates visualization, 
 plan abstraction and its integration, and language constructs into one teaching and learning environment known as VPCL. 
 There are three phases of VPCL, Plan Observation or Rehearsal, Plan Integration or Composition, and Plan Creation or Innovation.
 The observation Phase teaches how a program (plan) is broken down into smaller components known as a plan with their relationship. 
 Each plan may further break down into smaller plans. At the last level plans are illustrated by language constructs. 
 The integration phase concentrates on how plans are related to each other to build a program using the four methods of integration. 
 The creation phase concentrates on how a new plan is created using the existing plans along with system resources. 
 VPCL can be applied to other problem solving tasks such as mathematics, science, physics, chemistry, biology, or linguistics.
